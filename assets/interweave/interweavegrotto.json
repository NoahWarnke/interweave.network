      "desc": "You are standing on a loose beach of shattered slate rocks at the edge of a deep clear pool of water, perhaps five times your height across. High walls of slate rise from the water in all directions ahead of you, covered in bright green ferns and mosses. Water drips down the walls, moistening the plant life. Far above, the walls end, and you can see blue sky and puffy clouds drifting by. Sunlight slants in from the hole above, illuminating the wall to your left and part of the pool. You see tiny fish glittering in the sunbeams shining through their aquatic world. Behind you, the walls surround your small rocky beach, but a dark crack of a tunnel entrance gapes from the cliff directly opposite the pool, jaggedly reaching perhaps twice your height and width. It is mostly silent except for the dripping of water and the crunch of gravel beneath your feet."

      "names": ["moss", "mosses", "fern", "ferns"],
      "desc": "The green plant life springs lushly from every crack and crevice of the slate walls. The occasional drop from above strikes a fern, making it bob up and down as smaller droplets tumble into the pool below. The mosses glisten in places as water soaks through them."

      "names": ["tunnel", "crevice", "crack"],
      "desc": "Several layers of the sedimentary slate, which everywhere is resting at about a 60-degree angle from the horizontal, have separated, leaving a dark, angular crack in the rocky walls, about twice your height vertically, and twice your width horizontally. You could easily fit inside."

    {
      "names": ["fish"],
      "desc": "The small minnow-sized fish swim lazily together in a school, sometimes glinting in the sunbeam from above, sometimes invisible in the shadows away from it. From time to time, you see one dart to the surface and swallow a small insect that had the misfortune of landing there."

      "desc": "You squat down and pick up a piece of slate from the beach near your feet. It's a fine-grained sedimentary stone, pale blue-grey, about one finger-width thick and two hands in breadth. You see the distorted fossils of tiny sea creatures scattered about one side of it."

      "names": ["walls", "rock walls", "cliff"],
      "desc": "The mossy slate walls, their layers at about 60 degrees from the horizontal, rise roughly all around you, forming a sort of irregular tube that appears to continue upwards for at least ten times your height before opening to the sky. At about eye level to your right, above where the water's edge meets the wall, there seem to be some words carved into the rock."

      "names": ["words", "carving", "rock carving"],
      "desc": "You closely inspect the words carved into the rock wall. They are neatly engraved, as by an expert stonemason with good tools, but also weathered; mosses peek out from several places on the letters. They read, in sans-serif English characters about two finger-widths high, 'WELCOME TO INTERWEAVE GROTTO. HERE IT ALL BEGAN.'"

You shift your weight and the slate cobbles beneath your feet crunch slightly."
