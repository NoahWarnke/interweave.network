      "verbs": ["go", "go into", "enter"],
      "leaveDesc": "You enter the tunnel at floor level. The bright light makes it easy to see where you're going as you navigate the uneven pillar floor of the tunnel. You have to duck now and then as the ceiling pillars are sometimes quite low. The tunnel curves to the right and begins to descend, and then the igneous rock pillars abruptly transition into a sedimentary slate. The string of lights also ends here, and soon there is very little light.",
      "enterDesc": "After you continue for a ways in near-darkness, the tunnel begins to become lighter again. You approach the light, and find an electric cable with regular lightbulbs attached to the wall of the tunnel, which has also suddenly changed to a curiously hexagonal igneous rock from the earlier sedimentary slate. You carefully make your way down this tunnel, avoiding bumping your head on low-hanging rocks, until you emerge into a large underground room."

      "leaveDesc": "You climb the rough stairway about halfway, and duck into the dark opening between the wall pillars. It is very tight and dark, and you soon find yourself crawling along the steeply upward-sloping tunnel by feel.",
      "enterDesc": "You carefully crawl down the tight, dark tunnel, descending further amid the hexagonal pillars of rock. Eventually you emerge into a large underground room and make your way down a rough stairway to the chamber floor."

      "leaveDesc": "You climb all the way up the rough stairway, taking care not to fall to the floor a good way below you. The pillar stairs essentially continue into the ceiling, and you continue climbing without interruption. The cable of lights continues along the wall to your left, lighting the hexagonal pillar walls as you ascend.",
      "enterDesc": "You descend the steep staircase of hexagonal rock pillars, the lights to your right ensuring you don't stumble. You soon emerge down through the ceiling of a large chamber, and the rough stairway continues, curving to your left along the wall of the chamber, until you reach the floor."

      "desc": "You stand in the middle of a roughly circular underground chamber about ten paces across, composed entirely of hexagonal pillars of some type of igneous rock, each about one pace in diameter. The pillars that make up the walls are all joined together and stretch from floor to ceiling, a height of around eight times yours. The floor and ceiling themselves are composed of the uneven, jagged stumps of these pillars, seeming to have been broken off. A series of these broken floor pillars gets higher and higher along the wall to your left, forming a very crude stairway. There are two openings amid the wall pillars there, one midway up the stairway at about your ten o'clock position, and another right up next to the roof, at about three o'clock. Behind where you stand on one of the pillar stumps, another tunnel opens into the wall at floor level. Everything is lit by several electric lights suspended from a cable running out of the upper tunnel entrance, down the wall next to the staircase, and reaching into the tunnel behind you."

      "desc": "The hexagonal pillars composing every natural surface in the room are made of a fine-grained basaltic rock, likely of igneous origin. The flat vertical faces of the tightly-connected pillars give the walls a striped, faceted appearance, stark in the electric lighting. The rough ends of the pillars forming the floor and ceiling are uneven, with some sticking up past the others, making walking in the chamber difficult. Small gravel of the same rock is present, but the absence of larger chunks indicates that this room was not carved by a natural process. The air is very still and slightly stuffy."
