The walls are made up of parts of these pillars all joined together and stretching floor to ceiling, a height of around eight times yours, while the floor and ceiling are composed of uneven, jagged stumps of these pillars, seeming to have been broken off. A series of these broken floor pillars get higher and higher along the wall to your left, forming a very crude stairway. There are two openings amid the pillars there, one midway up the stairway at about your ten o'clock position, and another right up next to the roof, at about three o-clock. Behind where you stand on one of the pillar stumps, another tunnel opens into the wall at floor level. Everything is lit by several electric lights suspended from a black wire running out of the upper tunnel entrance, down the wall next to the staircase, and reaching into the tunnel behind you."

The flat vertical faces of the tightly-connected pillars give the walls a striped, faceted appearance, stark in the electric lighting. The rough ends of the pillars forming the floor and ceiling are uneven, with some sticking up past the others, making walking in the chamber difficult. Small gravel of the same rock is present, but the absence of larger chunks indicates that this room was not carved by a natural process."
