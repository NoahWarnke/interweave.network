# Interweave Network: A Decentralized Graph Representing an Explorable, User-Built Heterogeneous Metaverse

## Abstract
Human existence revolves around our twin needs to *explore*, experiencing our environment, and to *build*, modifying it. Computer-based manifestations of our urge to explore, including the World Wide Web and computer games, have commensurately proved to be enormously significant in modern culture and society. But users do not have perfect freedom to wander the digital frontier -- games in particular are highly siloed from one another, with one virtual world rarely reachable from within any other. Our desire to build has proven considerably more difficult to fulfill, an asymmetry suffered partly because of a lack of know-how, but also significantly at the hands of centralization. Gatekeepers like domain registrars and monolithic game studios have made obtaining a website, or adding something to a favorite game world, difficult or impossible for the average Internet user, who is left with the meager Facebook post or YouTube vlog as their primary creative outlet.

The Interweave Network project proposes to eliminate the explore/build asymmetry in the <a href="https://www.nealstephenson.com/snow-crash.html">metaverse</a> and make meeting these equally important needs equally frictionless.

A new type of digital tool, the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper">programmable blockchain</a>, has recently emerged to provide mechanisms for decentralizing and finalizing arbitrary state transitions. The Interweave Network will use such a framework to disentangle the simple acts of visiting shared virtual locations and creating new ones from the inequitable and insecure concentrations of power that currently comprise the status quo.

The Interweave Network will consist of a decentralized graph on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> blockchain, whose nodes can represent literally anything conceptually identifiable as a *place*, and frontend viewer applications that connect to the smart contracts containing this graph, interpret node and edge data for users, and provide an interface for creating new content. The Network will allow its users to create, own, transfer, and connect nodes in an easy, fair, and secure manner. Nodes will each be an instance of an <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md">ERC-721</a> non-fungible token with additional properties like a data URL and list of edges connecting to other nodes that can be managed only by the owners of the nodes involved. Critically, nodes will be an *unlimited* resource: users can create as many as they can afford the gas for. Value will come not from scarcity, but from quality and connectedness.

The end goal of the project is to interweave every virtual place possible, existing and new, into one seamless, metaverse-spanning network.

## Existing Work

What similar things are being used as inspiration and examples of what to do (or not to do)?


- Adventure-esque games
  - Zork
- Hyperstudio
- World Wide Web
- Online sandbox games:
  - Second Life
  - Wurm Online
- Decentraland


## Rationale

Why does this project make sense to develop versus using that existing work?

- Decentralized, unlike everything except Decentraland. Reduces security and censorship risks.
- Every node within the Network will be on equal footing, and can be connected with any other node. No place will need to be 'siloed' for technological or competitive reasons (more connections will almost always be desirable for both connected parties.)
- Unlimited building potential with no arbitrary scarcity, unlike Decentraland.
- Very low barrier to entry for building, being feeless apart from gas (and possible Ethereum rent someday).

## Philosophy

What values does the project hope to promote?

- Open source development
- Fair for all participants (all functionality available to everyone regardless of wealth or when they arrive)
- Nonprofit infrastructure: project developers are not aiming to make money from the running of the Network.
  - Small fees may be charged solely for paying Ethereum rent someday.
  - Creators and early users may be able to make money by having nodes built earlier in the system, and thus older and more central to the eventual network and thus potentially more valuable... But no special privileges relative to the infrastructure.
- Flexible: formats are unspecified by the Network, and the project explicitly hopes people will develop many of these.
- Aesthetic appeal: the locations nodes represent should strive to be 'eye candy', or 'mind's eye candy' in the case of text-based nodes. Exploring should be fun and rewarding.


## Architecture

In broad strokes, what technical components will the project be composed of?

## Applications

Once up and running, what problems will the project solve or new capabilities will it enable for its users?

- Initially, as a game itself
- As glue between and method for locating existing games relative to each other
- As a free framework where you can build yourself a 'place' in the virtual world that you alone own and control (see 'profiles' on most social sites... but these always fail to be a truly immersive 'place', being just sterile slabs of UI with some blanks filled in)


## Challenges

What aspects of the project are especially risky with respect to getting it completed and working as designed?
