# Interweaver's to-do items, 2018-11-21:


- [ ] Build Version 1 (the "free version", i.e. without any way to exchange money) of the Interweave Network.
  - [ ] Create functional DApp:
    - [ ] Make build mode:
      - [ ] Formod1 create node:
        - [ ] Give it a dropdown to pick one of the formods (may need to add formod string names.)
        - [ ] When a formod is selected, set a variable to the correct one.
        - [ ] Make a component slot for the actual formod build component.
        - [ ] Make a basic SimpleTextBuild component.
        - [ ] Make it render when you select it in TheNodeBuilder
        - [ ] Make it stop rendering when you click Add Node again.
        - [ ] Give it an 'output' button.
        - [ ] Make clicking it open a modal with a text area containing the JSON output (for your IPFS file).
        - [ ] Make the modal have an 'x' that closes it.
        - [ ] Add fields for various SimpleText properties:
          - [ ]
      - [ ] My Edge Proposals
        - [ ] Create an app mode for myedgeproposals
        - [ ] Create a test EdgeProposal or two.
        - [ ] Show paged view of all my EdgeProposal keys.
        - [ ] Load EdgeProposal blockchain data (so getting the two Node keys and epmess and slots).
      - [ ] Edge Proposal
        - [ ] Create an App mode for edgeproposal
        - [ ] Show current EdgeProposal key
        - [ ] Show blockchain data
        - [ ] Load Node data and show the names
        - [ ] Make clicking on the Nodes go to them.
    - [ ] Extensively test!
    - [ ] Share somewhere, and fix bugs that people find, haha. This being the "free version", less (but not nothing) is at stake.
  - [ ] Smart contracts
    - [ ] When DApp is ready to share, compile and deploy to testnet!
    - [ ] When DApp is tested and ready to go, deploy to mainnet!
    
- [ ] Build Version 2 (the "payable version", i.e. with the ability to pay/be paid for EdgeProposals, and Nodes are ERC-721s)

- [ ] Write whitepaper:
    - [ ] Fill in sections. Note: leave out implementation details (anything as specific as which smart contracts or fields need to be created.) That goes in yellow paper.
      - [ ] Rationale for Interweave Network
      - [ ] Philosophy
      - [ ] Architecture
      - [ ] Applications
      - [ ] Challenges
      - [ ] Summary
      - [ ] Further Reading
    - [ ] Let sit for a few days while doing other things.
    - [ ] Revisions, round 1.
    - [ ] Let sit for another few days while doing other things.
    - [ ] Revisions, round 2.
    - [ ] Publish (reddit? medium? Lol, I've seen enough whitepapers to know where this is going. Not that I have any reach...)
