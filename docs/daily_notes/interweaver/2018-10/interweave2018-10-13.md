# Interweaver's to-do items, 2018-10-13:


- [ ] Design the Interweave Network.
  - [ ] Rewrite interweave design documents into whitepaper-style document with more carefully-thought-out ideas.
    - [ ] Fill in sections. Note: leave out implementation details (anything as specific as which smart contracts or fields need to be created.) That goes in yellow paper.
      - [X] Existing work
        - [X] Research similar concepts beyond games I'm already familiar with:
          - sandbox games with user ownership of land
            - Minecraft: Users own the servers, rather than specific land.
              - Some modded versions had ways to go between different servers in-game (Bukkit?)
            - Wurm Online
            - Second Life
          - "open world" concept: players explore and approach objectives freely, no invisible walls/loading screens
            - GTA, etc.
          - interconnected games frameworks
            - My Google-fu is not strong enough.
          - portals between worlds games
            - OpenCroquet/Colbalt (http://wiki.c2.com/?OpenCroquet, http://www.opencobalt.net/) was the thing I remember from 10 years ago with the portals between worlds...
              - The idea was users built their own 3D spaces, and then hyperlink to them (via portals).
              - It was intended to be a new type of web browser.
              - "It's a framework for building cooperative, 3D spaces. Theoretically, you could reimplement Second Life on top of Croquet, or rather, multiple SecondLifes that could talk to each other."
          - user-created text-based adventures (sandbox?)
            - First: Colossal Cave Adventure. Graph of locations.
            - Lots of Interactive Fiction building tools nowadays, but I couldn't find any connected-world ones...
              - http://twinery.org/, etc.
          - networks on ethereum
            - Nothing for "network graphs within ethereum" in the first 10 Google pages...
          - graphs on ethereum
          
          - Okay conclusion: if similar things on the blockchain exist (other than Decentraland) they are horribly bad at SEO.
          - And if similar things not on blockchain exist (the open user-created text based world), I'm too bad at Googling to find it too. Lol...
        - [X] Write
      - [ ] Rationale for Interweave Network
      - [ ] Philosophy
      - [ ] Architecture
      - [ ] Applications
      - [ ] Challenges
      - [ ] Summary
      - [ ] Further Reading
    - [ ] Let sit for a few days while doing other things.
    - [ ] Revisions, round 1.
    - [ ] Let sit for another few days while doing other things.
    - [ ] Revisions, round 2.
    - [ ] Publish (reddit? medium? Lol, I've seen enough whitepapers to know where this is going. Not that I have any reach...)

- [ ] Try setting up an IPFS node of my own (just for practice)

- [X] Try setting up a geth node of my own (just for practice)
  - Download geth
  - cd to extracted directory
  - ./geth --testnet --syncmode=fast --mine --datadir /media/noah/55aff53c-1218-4a37-bb18-c3a119f3a96b1/.ethereum/testnet --etherbase '0x002e67f620dda8a9141e262e125938bb28048cd1'
  - Wait for several hours for sync
  - Mining is slow!
 
- [ ] Build the network!
  - [ ] Stage 1a
    - [ ] Non-transferrable nodes (not yet ERC721)
    - [ ] Non-deletable edges that you can create between any of your own nodes (that don't already have an edge)
    - [ ] Uses normal URLs for the link value (up to 100 chars)
    - [ ] Node format 1 (simple text) node and edge 1 format (edge-edge, edge-else, else-edge)
    - [ ] Simple front-end viewer that supports exploring a network built of nodetype1 and edgetype1
    - [ ] Network built via direct function calls, not through the viewer.
  - [ ] Stage 1b
    - [ ] Viewer supports a way to add nodes and edges and keep track of your account's nodes.
  - [ ] Stage 1c
    - [ ] Node format 2 (images) and edges 2 format (image-image, image-else, else-image)
  - [ ] Stage 2a
    - [ ] Nodes ERC721 and thus transferrable
    - [ ] Edges proposable according to proposition rules.
    - [ ] Edges deletable according to edge deletion rules.
  - [ ] Stage 2b
    - [ ] Edge proposals/deletions (and node transfers?) in viewer.
  - [ ] Stage 3a
    - [ ] Nodes switch to only supporting IPFS URLs.
  - [ ] Stage 3b
    - [ ] IPFS uploads through the viewer.
  - [ ] Stage 4
    - [ ] Additional formats, like 3d, etc.
