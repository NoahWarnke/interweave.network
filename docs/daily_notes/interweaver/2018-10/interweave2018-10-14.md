# Interweaver's to-do items, 2018-10-14:


- [ ] Design the Interweave Network.
  - [ ] Rewrite interweave design documents into whitepaper-style document with more carefully-thought-out ideas.
    - [ ] Fill in sections. Note: leave out implementation details (anything as specific as which smart contracts or fields need to be created.) That goes in yellow paper.
      - [ ] Rationale for Interweave Network
      - [ ] Philosophy
      - [ ] Architecture
      - [ ] Applications
      - [ ] Challenges
      - [ ] Summary
      - [ ] Further Reading
    - [ ] Let sit for a few days while doing other things.
    - [ ] Revisions, round 1.
    - [ ] Let sit for another few days while doing other things.
    - [ ] Revisions, round 2.
    - [ ] Publish (reddit? medium? Lol, I've seen enough whitepapers to know where this is going. Not that I have any reach...)

- [X] Try setting up an IPFS node of my own (just for practice)
  - Download go-ipfs: https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs
  - Extract to a folder
  - cd to that folder
  - sudo ./install.sh
  - ipfs help (works!)
  - ipfs init
  - verify stuff is in /home/username/.ipfs
  - ipfs daemon
  - ipfs swarm peers (should list a bunch of peers)
  - Open new terminal
  - ipfs cat /ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/readme (should show a file.)
  - ipfs add -q myfilename.txt (should create a file on your local node and return a hash: 46 characters long)
  - QmaMZq3WqS7VGLF8Aie47pXm7pjDxCn8QSBn1HZyvg5yFJ
  - curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/hash" (should find your file on the local ipfs node)
  - curl "htts://ipfs.io/ipfs/hash" (should find your file on the IPFS gateway node! Cool!)
  - ipfs pin ls | egrep recursive (to see roots of recursive pins on your local node)
  
- [X] Update StoreLink contract to SetHash contract
  - [X] Change string length to 46 from 32
  - [X] Add a require error message.
  - [X] Test in remix
  - [X] Make local .sol file
  - [X] Compile with solcjs:
    - [X] Navigate to location of file
    - [X] solcjs --bin sethash.sol
    - [X] solcjs --abi sethash.sol
  - [X] Deploy on Ropsten with MetaMask and MyCrypto
    - tx hash: 0xad0176a3875beef1ad5ca1bf7ed97abd3075e10db2cbd1225d777d5637bedfc4
    - Okay, Ropsten is down due to Constantinople hijinks...
    - Get Rinkeby test eth from http://rinkeby-faucet.com/ (0.001, lol)
    - Deploy with cheap gas: 0xB3AC9B8eF39B5feF2E68d16444e72C5878E48514
    - Sweet, went through!
  - [X] Change dapp to reference new contract on Rinkeby
  - [X] Change dapp to use 46-char message instead of 32-char message
  - [X] Change dapp to link to ipfs if message is present.
  
 
- [ ] Build the network!
  - [ ] Stage 1a
    - [ ] Non-transferrable nodes (not yet ERC721)
    - [ ] Non-deletable edges that you can create between any of your own nodes (that don't already have an edge)
    - [ ] Uses normal URLs for the link value (up to 100 chars)
    - [ ] Node format 1 (simple text) node and edge 1 format (edge-edge, edge-else, else-edge)
    - [ ] Simple front-end viewer that supports exploring a network built of nodetype1 and edgetype1
    - [ ] Network built via direct function calls, not through the viewer.
  - [ ] Stage 1b
    - [ ] Viewer supports a way to add nodes and edges and keep track of your account's nodes.
  - [ ] Stage 1c
    - [ ] Node format 2 (images) and edges 2 format (image-image, image-else, else-image)
  - [ ] Stage 2a
    - [ ] Nodes ERC721 and thus transferrable
    - [ ] Edges proposable according to proposition rules.
    - [ ] Edges deletable according to edge deletion rules.
  - [ ] Stage 2b
    - [ ] Edge proposals/deletions (and node transfers?) in viewer.
  - [ ] Stage 3a
    - [ ] Nodes switch to only supporting IPFS URLs.
  - [ ] Stage 3b
    - [ ] IPFS uploads through the viewer.
  - [ ] Stage 4
    - [ ] Additional formats, like 3d, etc.
