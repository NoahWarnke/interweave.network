# Interweaver's to-do items, 2018-10-08:

- [X] Organize, convert to .md, and commit? my notes on the project.
  - My old checklist format was \*s instead of Xs... Convert.
  - My old list format was simply \*s with arbitrary amounts of whitespace indentation (usually one or two spaces). Convert to \-s.
- [ ] Design the Interweave Network.
  - [ ] Rewrite interweave design documents into whitepaper-style document with more carefully-thought-out ideas.
    - [X] Read a few design documents/whitepapers for existing projects, to get a feel for the general style of these things.
      - Ethereum whitepaper (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper):
        - Title
        - Abstract
        - (Table of contents)
        - Existing projects/concepts
        - This project
        - Philosophy
        - Component1..n
        - Applications
        - Concerns (attack/instability cases and how to avoid)
        - Conclusion
        - Notes/further reading
      - Decentraland whitepaper (https://decentraland.org/whitepaper.pdf)
        - Title page
        - Authors
        - Abstract
        - (Table of contents)
        - Introduction
          - Rationale for project (weak)
          - History of project
          - Traversible world (interesting, talks about their motivation for real estate scarcity instead of an infinite supply)
          - Economy
          - Use cases
        - Architecture
        - Economy
        - Challenges
        - Summary
      - The Ethereum one didn't have a numbering scheme, but the Decentraland one did. Interesting.
    - [X] Create new whitepaper document
      - .md? .odt? .pdf?
      - .md, then use markdown-pdf atom package to compile to pdf.
    - [X] Create sections (from my previous design document notes).
      - Title
      - (Leave out authors - let's have this be open source.)
      - Abstract
      - Table of contents
      - Existing work
      - Rationale for Interweave Network
      - Philosophy
      - Architecture
      - Applications
      - Challenges
      - Summary
      - Further Reading
    - [ ] Fill in sections. Note: leave out implementation details (anything as specific as which smart contracts or fields need to be created.) That goes in yellow paper.
      - [ ] Abstract
      - [ ] Table of contents
      - [ ] Existing work
      - [ ] Rationale for Interweave Network

      - [ ] Summary
      - [ ] Further Reading
    - [ ] Let sit for a few days while doing other things.
    - [ ] Revisions, round 1.
    - [ ] Let sit for another few days while doing other things.
    - [ ] Revisions, round 2.
    - [ ] Publish (reddit? medium? Lol, I've seen enough whitepapers to know where this is going. Not that I have any reach...)
- [ ] Build the network!
  - [ ] Stage 1a
    - [ ] Non-transferrable nodes (not yet ERC721)
    - [ ] Non-deletable edges that you can create between any of your own nodes (that don't already have an edge)
    - [ ] Uses normal URLs for the link value (up to 100 chars)
    - [ ] Node format 1 (simple text) node and edge 1 format (edge-edge, edge-else, else-edge)
    - [ ] Simple front-end viewer that supports exploring a network built of nodetype1 and edgetype1
    - [ ] Network built via direct function calls, not through the viewer.
  - [ ] Stage 1b
    - [ ] Viewer supports a way to add nodes and edges and keep track of your account's nodes.
  - [ ] Stage 1c
    - [ ] Node format 2 (images) and edges 2 format (image-image, image-else, else-image)
  - [ ] Stage 2a
    - [ ] Nodes ERC721 and thus transferrable
    - [ ] Edges proposable according to proposition rules.
    - [ ] Edges deletable according to edge deletion rules.  
  - [ ] Stage 2b
    - [ ] Edge proposals/deletions (and node transfers?) in viewer.
  - [ ] Stage 3a
    - [ ] Nodes switch to only supporting IPFS URLs.
  - [ ] Stage 3b
    - [ ] IPFS uploads through the viewer.
  - [ ] Stage 4
    - [ ] Additional formats, like 3d, etc.
